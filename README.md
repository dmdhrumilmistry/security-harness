# Security Harness

A multi-agent **application-security review harness** for Claude Code (and, later, other AI agents). One
router skill dispatches to a full offensive-security pipeline that **maps** a codebase, **hunts**
vulnerabilities with a per-class knowledge base, **chains** findings into escalations, **verifies** real
impact, and **reports** to README / JSON / SARIF / doc / PDF.

> Scope: this harness performs **static** analysis (source review, data-flow tracing, PoC/payload
> construction) on code you own or are authorized to test. It does not attack live third-party systems.

### Vulnerability classes covered (the `sh-kb-*` skills)

access-control (IDOR/BOLA/priv-esc) · sqli · xss · ssrf · injection (cmd/code/SSTI/LDAP) · auth (session/JWT)
· deserialization · path-traversal (LFI/RFI) · secrets · csrf · xxe · open-redirect · crypto · race-conditions
· file-upload. Dependency CVEs/SBOM are handled by the recon stage.

## Install

The harness ships for several agents. Full packaging details and the release
checklist are in [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md).

**Claude Code** - add this repo as a plugin marketplace and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add dmdhrumilmistry/security-harness
/plugin install security-harness
```

`/plugin marketplace add` accepts any of: a GitHub `owner/repo` (as above), a full git URL
(`https://github.com/dmdhrumilmistry/security-harness.git`), or a local path to a clone
(e.g. `/plugin marketplace add ./security-harness` from the directory containing your checkout).
Then run `/plugin install security-harness` and reload when prompted.

**Gemini CLI** - a native extension, manifest at the repo root:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/dmdhrumilmistry/security-harness
```

**opencode, Codex, or any [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) agent** - copy the
skills into a discovery directory. Codex additionally picks up `AGENTS.md` on its own:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmdhrumilmistry/security-harness
cd security-harness
python scripts/sync-agent-skills.py --install agents     # ~/.agents/skills
python scripts/sync-agent-skills.py --install opencode   # ~/.config/opencode/skills
```

**Graft is installed and set up automatically by the pipeline.** Stage 0 runs `npm install -g
@nanonets/graft` if it's missing (requires Node/npm), then `graft init <target> --no-agents --no-global`
to register the Graft MCP server and freshness hooks for the target repo. The graph itself (`<target>/graft/`,
auto-gitignored) is built during recon. To pre-install manually: `npm install -g @nanonets/graft`. Graft's
structural build is free and needs no API key; the optional `--deep` LLM pass uses `GRAFT_API_KEY` /
`GRAFT_PROVIDER` / `GRAFT_MODEL` when set.

**The other tools are also auto-installed by Stage 0 when missing** (via whatever package manager is on the
machine - winget/choco/scoop, brew, apt, npm/pip/go - see `references/tooling-setup.md`). Installs are
announced, prefer no-elevation methods, and never block the run: anything that can't be installed is simply
marked unavailable and the pipeline falls back. Stage 0 installs only what fills a missing capability group:

- SBOM: [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) · CVEs: one of [`grype`](https://github.com/anchore/grype)
  (preferred), [`trivy`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), or [`osv-scanner`](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner)
- Reports: `wkhtmltopdf` or `pandoc` (for PDF/DOCX); otherwise you get `report.html` (or a headless-Chrome PDF).

All of them are optional - the pipeline degrades gracefully to native search + manifest parsing if none install.

## Usage

Invoke the router with a natural-language request:

```
/sh-router full security review of ./api
/sh-router find SQLi and IDOR in src/
/sh-router just map this codebase        # recon only
```

Or call the pipeline directly:

```
/sh-security-review . classes:sqli,access-control,ssrf depth:deep
/sh-security-review . stage:report       # regenerate reports for the latest run
```

### Model & cost control

Each stage runs on a model matched to its cognitive load, so tokens are spent where discovery quality
actually depends on them and saved on mechanical work. **This is the default - no arguments needed.**

| Stage | Default model |
|---|---|
| recon | `sonnet` |
| hunt (per class) | `haiku` for pattern classes (secrets, crypto, open-redirect, csrf) · `sonnet` for source→sink tracing (sqli, xss, ssrf, injection, path-traversal, xxe, file-upload, auth) · `opus` for deep-logic classes (access-control, race-conditions, deserialization) |
| chain | `opus` |
| verify | `opus` (the precision gate - kept strong) |
| report | `haiku` |

Override with the `models:` argument (passed through the router too):

```
/sh-security-review .                         # default tiered map above
/sh-security-review . models:max              # every stage + hunter on opus (max quality, max cost)
/sh-security-review . models:cheap            # aggressive downshift (trades some verify precision)
/sh-security-review . models:verify=opus,hunt=sonnet          # per-stage overrides
/sh-security-review . models:report=sonnet,hunt.pattern=sonnet  # per-hunter-tier override
```

Stages: `setup, recon, hunt, chain, verify, report`. Models: `opus, sonnet, haiku, inherit`. For `hunt`,
a bare model flattens all hunters to it; `hunt.pattern` / `hunt.trace` / `hunt.logic` target one tier.
Other token savers are built in: recon only spawns hunters for classes with real attack surface, hunters
query the Graft graph instead of reading whole files, and `findings.json`/SARIF are generated by a
deterministic script rather than the model.

### Output

Everything lands under `<target>/.security-harness/<run-id>/`:

- `recon.md`, `codebase-map.json` - the map (stack, SBOM, CVEs, attack surface).
- `findings.jsonl` → `chains.md` → `verified.jsonl` - the working state (see `references/state-files.md`).
- `reports/` - `README.md`, `findings.json`, `results.sarif`, `report.html`, `report.pdf` (+ `report.docx`).

Each published finding carries a payload, a PoC, the verification verdict, CWE/OWASP ids, CVSS, and a
code-level mitigation.

## Pull request review

`sh-pr-review` reviews a single pull request rather than a whole codebase, posts the
result as inline comments **on the PR itself**, and sets a `security/pr-review` commit
status that branch protection can enforce.

**Run it from your own machine, on any PR you can read.** Install the plugin and ask:

```
review https://github.com/acme/api/pull/128
review PR 42
security review this PR
```

**Paste a PR link** and it reviews that PR in that repository, cloning it to a temporary
directory first, because the hunters read files and not just the patch. Nothing is
written into the repo you are working in.

**Pass a bare number** and it resolves against **the repo you are currently in**, the one
`git remote` points at. Pass nothing and it takes the open PR for your current branch.

Phase 7 prints the findings and the verdict and **asks before posting anything** - a
decline is a normal outcome, and the payload stays on disk for you to post later.

Before spending any analysis it checks whether you can actually write to the target repo,
so reviewing someone else's project tells you up front that posting will 403 rather than
discovering it ten minutes in.

Three properties make it usable as a merge gate rather than noise:

- **Only what the PR is responsible for fails it.** Every finding carries a `pr_impact`
  of `introduced`, `aggravated`, or `pre_existing`. The first two block; `pre_existing`
  is reported and never blocks. Blocking a merge over code the author never wrote is how
  a required check gets deleted, so when a hunter is unsure between `aggravated` and
  `pre_existing`, it must pick `pre_existing`.
- **Depth follows risk.** Triage runs first, in the orchestrator, with no subagents. It
  maps changed paths and added-line sink tokens onto the same class slugs the `sh-kb-*`
  bases use, then picks a tier. Tier 0 (no security-relevant change) launches nothing at
  all and still sets the status. Tier 3 runs the full pipeline.
- **Re-pushes do not spam.** Each comment carries a hidden fingerprint computed without
  line numbers, so a re-review adds only what is new and lists what was fixed as
  "Resolved since the last review".

| Verdict | Status | When |
|---|---|---|
| fail | `failure` | introduced or aggravated finding at or above `--fail-on` (default `medium`), confidence >= 80 |
| warn | `success` | nothing introduced or aggravated; pre-existing findings reported |
| pass | `success` | no findings, or triage stopped at Tier 0 |
| error | `error` | the review could not complete |

`warn` reports `success` on purpose: a warning that blocks a merge is a failure with
extra steps, and teams respond by removing the check. `error` is kept distinct from
`failure` so a broken run never looks like a vulnerability it did not find.

The review event is always `COMMENT`, never `REQUEST_CHANGES` or `APPROVE`. The commit
status is the enforcement mechanism, and it is the one branch protection reads.

**Scope:** the skill writes to the pull request and the commit status, and nowhere else.
It opens no issues and creates nothing in any external tracker.

### Re-reviews are incremental

A PR gets reviewed once per push, so the second review has to be cheaper than the first or
the tool becomes something people turn off.

**Dedup happens before the spending, not before the posting.** The fingerprints already on
the PR are read in Phase 1 and handed to the hunters and the verifier. Finding a duplicate
at the end would mean the most expensive model in the pipeline had already re-confirmed a
conclusion that was written on the PR the whole time. This needs no cache: the state lives
in the PR, so it works on a cold machine and in CI.

**A local cache makes the rest incremental.** `sh-review-cache` stores each run's file
hashes, findings and verdicts under your OS cache directory (never in the repo, since a
cross-repo review runs in a temp clone that gets deleted). The next review re-hunts only
files whose content actually changed, reuses verdicts for findings that are unchanged, and
reuses the recon map if nothing it covers moved.

**A base-branch merge costs nothing.** Merging `main` into a PR branch changes the head
SHA and nothing the author wrote, but a commit status is pinned to a SHA, so the required
check silently disappears from the new head. When the PR's own files are byte-identical
*and* the base delta touches nothing the findings depend on, the previous verdict is
re-stamped onto the new SHA with no agents launched at all. That last condition is what
makes it safe: a base merge that deletes a sanitizer leaves every PR file unchanged while
turning a safe line into an exploitable one.

Invalidation is deliberately conservative, because a stale entry in a security tool does
not make it slow, it makes it **wrong**. The cache key hashes every `sh-kb-*` knowledge
base, so a KB update invalidates every cached finding - a cached "clean" must never
suppress the finding that update was written to catch. Model identity, skill version, file
content and a 7-day TTL all invalidate too, and an unspecified model is treated as a miss.

`--no-cache` disables it, `--refresh-cache` re-baselines, and `run.md` records per phase
what was launched, reused and skipped, so a cache that quietly stops hitting is visible
rather than assumed.

### Running it unattended

Optional, and a separate decision from using the skill. Run it by hand on your own PRs
for a while first, so you know what it says about your codebase before it says it in
front of your team.

When you are ready, "Enforcing the check on a repository" in
[`references/pr-review-mapping.md`](plugins/security-harness/references/pr-review-mapping.md)
has a copy-paste workflow for **your** repo, plus the fail-safe that stops a dead job
leaving a required check stuck on `pending`.

The threshold stays at the default `medium`. Pre-existing findings never block a merge,
so an unscanned codebase does not produce a wall of red on day one - only what a PR
actually introduces or aggravates can fail it.

## How it works

1. **Setup** - probe available tools, define scope, create the run directory.
2. **Recon** (`sh-recon`) - build the Graft graph; detect stack/versions; SBOM + CVEs; enumerate entry
   points, trust boundaries, and dangerous sinks.
3. **Hunt** (`sh-hunter` ×N, parallel) - one hunter per relevant class loads its `sh-kb-*` knowledge base,
   traces attacker input from source to sink, and records candidates. A shared **attempts ledger** stops
   agents from repeating each other's probes.
4. **Chain** (`sh-chainer`) - compose findings into higher-severity attack paths.
5. **Verify** (`sh-verifier`) - refute first, then confirm exploitability from evidence, build PoCs, assign
   CVSS, and cut false positives.
6. **Report** (`sh-reporter`) - produce the deliverables.

Subagents share nothing but files; the contract is in `plugins/security-harness/references/state-files.md`.

## Extending

Add a new vulnerability class by creating `skills/sh-kb-<class>/SKILL.md` following the shared template
(When to hunt · Sources & sinks · Detection recipe · Payloads/PoC · False-positive filters · CWE/OWASP ·
Chaining hints · Mitigation), then add its slug to the `class` enum in `references/finding-schema.json`
and the routing table in `skills/sh-router/SKILL.md`.

## Automated knowledge-base updates

A scheduled GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update-knowledge-base.yml`) keeps the `sh-kb-*` knowledge
bases fresh. **Every alternate day** (and on manual `workflow_dispatch`), it runs an agent to distill new,
reputable public security research - OWASP, PortSwigger Research, CWE/CAPEC, NIST, MDN, curated GitHub
repos, and public HackerOne disclosures - into small, well-sourced improvements. A **second, adversarial
reviewer agent** then scans the resulting diff for malicious/injected content, and the PR is
**auto-merged only if that reviewer approves**.

### Two workflows, three jobs

PR creation is deliberately separated from review and merge, so the thing that writes
the diff is never the thing that decides to ship it.

**Stage 1 - [`update-knowledge-base.yml`](.github/workflows/update-knowledge-base.yml)**
(scheduled or manual). One job, `create-pr`:

1. **Generate** - the agent edits the KB from allowlisted sources. No commit, no push.
2. **Open PR** - a deterministic step opens (or updates) a PR on the `automated/kb-update`
   branch, labeled `awaiting-review`.
3. **Hand off** - on a successful PR creation it dispatches stage 2 with the PR number.

**Stage 2 - [`kb-review-and-merge.yml`](.github/workflows/kb-review-and-merge.yml)**
(dispatched by stage 1, or run by hand against any automated PR). Two jobs:

- **`review`** - a *separate* agent run inspects the diff **adversarially** for
  prompt-injection artifacts, out-of-scope edits, secrets/exfil, PII, weaponized
  exploits, off-allowlist sourcing, or house-style violations. It has **no web and no
  shell**, and **fails closed**: anything suspicious, any uncertainty, or a missing
  verdict file → REJECT. The verdict is posted as a PR comment and drives the label.
- **`merge`** - runs **only** on `APPROVE`, and merges the PR. A `REJECT` skips it and
  the `blocked` job reports why.

> **Why a dispatch rather than a `pull_request` trigger:** a PR opened by `GITHUB_TOKEN`
> does not trigger `pull_request` workflows. `workflow_dispatch` is one of the two events
> exempt from that recursion guard, so stage 1 can hand off reliably.

**Auto-merge means an approving agent lands code in `main`.** The controls on that:

- The merge job refuses any PR that is closed, from a fork, or whose head branch is
  outside `automated/*` (`ALLOWED_HEAD_PREFIX` in the workflow).
- It prefers GitHub's own auto-merge, so **branch protection still applies**. With a rule
  on `main` requiring an approving review, the PR queues and waits for a human instead of
  merging. It falls back to an immediate merge only on repos where auto-merge is off.
- Set the `auto_merge` input to `false` on a manual run to review without merging.
- The reviewer prompt tells the agent its verdict is binding, not advisory.

> Requires the repo setting **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** (Settings →
> Actions → General → Workflow permissions) so the workflow can open the PR. If you want a human in the
> loop despite auto-merge, protect `main` with a branch-protection rule requiring a pull request and at
> least one approving review - the auto-merge path honours it.

### Pluggable agents

Both stages run through [`.github/actions/ai-agent`](.github/actions/ai-agent/action.yml),
a composite action that dispatches to whichever agent you configure. Claude Code, OpenAI
Codex, Gemini CLI, and an escape hatch for anything else:

| `agent` | Runs | Credential |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` (default) | `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `codex` | `codex exec --full-auto` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `gemini` | `gemini --yolo --prompt` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `custom` | your `KB_AGENT_INSTALL` / `KB_AGENT_COMMAND` | whatever it needs |

Pick per run from the `workflow_dispatch` inputs, or set repo variables to change the
default: `KB_AGENT` and `KB_MODEL` for the generator, `KB_REVIEW_AGENT` and
`KB_REVIEW_MODEL` for the reviewer. Running the generator and the reviewer on **different
agents** is a meaningful hardening step: an injection tuned for one model is less likely
to land on a second, independent one.

For `agent: custom`, set `KB_AGENT_COMMAND` to a shell command. The prompt is written to
the file named by `$AGENT_PROMPT_FILE`, and `$AGENT_MODEL` carries the model input.

Prompt-injection defenses, since the generator reads the open web:

- **Domain allowlist.** `WebFetch` is restricted to the trusted domains in
  `.github/kb-update/trusted-sources.md` (mirrored in the workflow's `--allowedTools`). `WebSearch` can
  discover URLs, but only allowlisted domains can actually be fetched.
- **Content is data, not commands.** The task prompt (`.github/kb-update/prompt.md`) instructs Claude to
  treat every fetched byte as untrusted reference material and to ignore any instructions embedded in a
  page - HackerOne report bodies (user-generated) are flagged as the highest-risk tier.
- **No shell, no push on the generator; the reviewer is the gate.** The generator can only edit files.
  The independent reviewer (`.github/kb-update/review-prompt.md`) is what stands between fetched content
  and `main` - nothing merges without its explicit approval.
- **Different agents for generator and reviewer.** Optional, and the strongest version of the gate: set
  `KB_AGENT` and `KB_REVIEW_AGENT` to two different engines.

**Setup:**

- Add the credential for whichever agent you use (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
  **`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`** (default), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
  The OAuth token authenticates against **your Claude subscription's usage limits** rather than a metered
  API key - generate it locally with `claude setup-token` (requires an active Claude Pro/Max subscription)
  and paste the result.
- Enable **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** (Settings → Actions → General →
  Workflow permissions) so the workflow can open its PR. Recommended: add a branch-protection rule on `main`
  requiring a PR and an approving review, so no automated change can land without a human even with
  auto-merge on.
- To change which sources are allowed, edit the allowlist in `trusted-sources.md` **and** the matching
  `WebFetch(domain:...)` entries in the workflow - keep the two in sync.

Each run records what it did in `.github/kb-update/last-run-summary.md`.
